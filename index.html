    So you'd like to know how to use impress.js?
    
    You've made the first, very important step - you're reading the source code.
    And that's how impress.js presentations are built - with HTML and CSS code.
    
    Believe me, you need quite decent HTML and CSS skills to be able to use impress.js effectively.
    More importantly, you need too be a designer. There are no default styles or layouts for impress.js presentations.
    
    You need to design and build it by hand.
    
    So...
    
    Would you still like to know how to use impress.js?

        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheets. It adds all of the styles it needs for the
        presentation to work.
        
        This style below contains styles only for demo presentation. Browse it to see how impress.js
        classes are used to style presentation steps, or how to apply fallback styles, but I don't want
        you to use them directly in your presentation.
        
        Be creative, build your own. We don't really want all impress.js presentations to look the same,
        do we?
        
        When creating your own presentation get rid of this file. Start from scratch, it's fun!

    Substeps are easy...  you can use these comments to see how they are done.
    NOTE: you will also have to add CSS for the '.substep' class to make anything happen
    See the css/substep.css for more details.

    If it's not entirely clear, you need the forked 'impress.js' script from this project's 
    js folder to make substeps work.  Otherwise, everything else is exactly the same as 
    the upstream impress.js, so you can use that project's docs, examples, etc.

    <!-- 

      Here is a regular impress.js step.  RTFM on impress.js to understand how this works, 
      but the TL;DR is the data-FOO properties are telling impress where to position each step.
      Adding class="step" is what lets impress.js know this is a step in your presentation 
=======
<!--
    
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
    
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.
    
    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective
    
    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things
    right around the corner of this tag ;)

      <h1 class="line">impress.js - substep example</h1>
      <p>This is an example of a presentation with substeps.</p>  
      <p>Use space bar or right arrow to go to the next step. </p>
      <p>Keep pressing to reveal substeps!</p>
      <h2>Ready?<h2>
    </div>

    <!-- 
      
      This where the money gets made.  By adding class="substep" to the list elements, they
      become substeps for impress.js to navigate.  They do not understand any of the data-FOO 
      properties.  All that happens is impress.js adds 'future', 'present', 'active', and 'past'
      to the substep elements, almost exactly the way impress.js handles steps.

      The almost part is around the 'active' class.  Substeps stay 'active' one you have been 
      over them.  A normal 'step' is only active when it's 'present'.

    <!--
        
        This is an example of step element being scaled.
        
        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
        down (4 times) to make it back to its correct size.

      Look, ma!  Another regular step!  This is here to illustrate that you can mix substeps into a
      a regular flow and the navigation makes sense.  Going backwark, the substeps will get played
      back, and the 'active' class will be removed when they return to being 'future' substeps.

        So to summarize of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:
        
        * `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
            the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
        * `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
            the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
            are exactly the same;
        * `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1
        
        These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
        CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

      If you use this, and you like it, and you notice my pull request never makes it back into the
      the upstream impress.js, maybe just give them a little nudge.  I'd rather not maintain an
      impress.js fork going forward.
