impress.js with substeps and pen annotations!
============

This is a fork of a fork of [impress.js][1]. The [first fork][2] adds substeps to slides. The goal of this fork is to add the ability to annotate on top of slides using the mouse pointer.

Look at simple_with_annotations.html to see annotations in action.

There is a lot of work to make this code more complete. I'm just starting now.
